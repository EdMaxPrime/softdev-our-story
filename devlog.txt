gaoJ -- 2017-10-26 14:45
Tested the link of stories generated when pulling information from the list of dictionaries of stories (which contain id, author, and content).

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-26 21:27
Renamed database manipulation files in util/ to reflect their real purpose. One will be used for searching the database, and another for modifying stories
Changed search.getAllStories() to actually poll the test database and return a list of dictionaries containing id, title, author and genre.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-26 22:17
Moved the story creation apparatus to mystory.py from search.py; imrpoved it to edit the master table and create an individual table for the new story.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-26 22:41
Renamed the story.html template to list.html since it displays all the stories. It also now displays the title, author and genre of each story. Centered the menubar in the base template.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-26 23:19
Added a form to filter search results and styled it, although it has no functionality. Hooked up the search bar in the menu to work with this form.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-26 23:36
Wrote and tested methods in search.py to filter the list of dictionaries by categories like author, genre and title.
The getAllStories method now puts more metadata in the dictionaries about each story. Wrote and tested method to filter by finished/not status.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-26 23:57
The "filter search results" form now has buttons to sort the results. Wrote and tested a method to sort stories by various categories.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-27 12:09
Moved the function that adds onto stories to the correct python file and improved it to accurately index contributions.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-27 13:24
Created a search results page. It uses the same template as the list of all stories, but it has all the logic to actually filter and sort the results. It will also show search results for users by their name. This is what the form from before will redirect to.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-27 14:12
The website has a new look; changed the color scheme and made the search results more presentable. The genre is now a link to search for all stories of that genre.
Speaking of genres, you can now search for several at a time by separating them with spaces. Multiple-word genres should not have underscores in them anymore.

zlotskiyM -- 2017-10-27 15:10
You can now sort search results by date modified. Had to import stuff from the old database into the test one. The create story form extends the base template.

gaoJ -- 2017-10-28 16:00
Added to /create/submit route, which is where data is directed after users submit the form to create a story.  This route calls methods that add information to the database.  I also generated the link where users are directed to after they hit submit.  Moreover, I outlined editStory.html (form to edit stories), fullStory.html (shows full story), and /story (display story or not, possibly lead to contribute) and /contribute (modify story) routes in ourStory.py.
