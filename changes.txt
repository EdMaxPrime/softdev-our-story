# Changes
Instead of having word limits, we decided to have character limits since that is a feature of textarea in HTML.

The original design document had a limited sitemap. On Day 3 of Creation (tuesday), a proper sitemap was
handrawn by the project manager based on how the group wanted the pages to look like. It incorporates the
principle of redirection to "virtual routes" that have no template and serve only to do logic. An example
is the logout page. The design for the menubar was also formalized on this same scrap of paper.

On Day 4 of Creation/Development, a new project management technique was put into place. Rather than have
everyone work on their own "spheres" of the website, everyone would work on the same part of it at the same time.
Example: Micheal makes the login route, William writes methods for login validation, and Jenny makes the login form.

The design document originally called for each story to have its own table, containing a list of contributions.
One of the columns was called "when" and it contained the date/time of the contributions. As it turns out, "when"
is an SQL keyword. The group decided rather than escaping this column name, we should change it to "timestamp." We also
decided to have each user have its own contribution field, since a user's contributions are an integral part of his/her
profile.
